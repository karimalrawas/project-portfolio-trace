The footer section includes links to social media home pages. 

Gallery

The gallery has images to some of the spots that will be shared with the community to visit and train at.

This section will allow the user to get signed up to the Trace Berlin community.

Testing

I used chrome developer tools to check how the site looks on different devices and screen sizes while maintaining it's practivality. 

Validator Testing

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Credits

I used two lines of code by Tim Wells to allign images and keep them responsive in different screen sizes: https://timnwells.medium.com/create-a-simple-responsive-image-gallery-with-html-and-css-fcb973f595ea


Content

The paragraphs in site were written by me, through my understanding of parkour and what the community will be like.

The icons in the footer were taken from Font Awesome

Media

I used an image from the official Red Bull website as the top background image, and images from Google Maps for spots in the Gallery section.
